/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialTrackMask) (TutorialTrackMask_Introduction, Introduction) */
/* A $track_mask is nothing more than list of scalars that controls, at a per-bone level,
   the weight of an animation.  This is somewhat like the weight of a $control, but
   obviously much finer-grained.  Using a $track_mask allows you to restrict animations to
   one part of the $skeleton, either permanently, or temporarily.  For instance, you might
   want to turn off the effect of your "walk" animation on your character's right arm
   while playing a "wave" animation as well.

   Granny gives you several tools to construct $(track_mask)s for your models.  At the
   lowest level, you can simply create a new mask with $NewTrackMask, and set the values
   per-bone with $SetTrackMaskBoneWeight.  If you know that you want to affect either all
   bones that are children of a specific $bone, or all bones that are parents of a given
   $bone, you can use $SetSkeletonTrackMaskChainUpwards or
   $SetSkeletonTrackMaskChainDownwards.  We'll use these functions in this demo to
   construct a $track_mask that only activates the upper body.

   If you want to allow your artists to generate $(track_mask)s, Granny provides a simple
   UI for doing so in Max and Maya.  The weights are stored in the ExtendedData field of
   each $bone, where they can be retrieved with $ExtractTrackMask, or manually, if you
   want.

   When you need to playback an animation with a mask applied, you have two options.  You
   can use the $controlled_animation_builder to create the control with the $track_mask
   pre-attached, or you can attach the mask to an existing $control $SetControlModelMask
   or $SetControlTrackMask.  You might want to reprise $TutorialCreateControl for the
   pluses and minuses of $BeginControlledAnimation versus $PlayControlledAnimation.

   One terminology related item you should be aware of is that Granny understands two
   types of track masks, each of which are implemented as a $track_mask object.  The first
   is a "Model TrackMask", which is what you'll most commonly be dealing with.  The second
   is a "Track TrackMask".  (I agree that the names aren't the best.)  The only difference
   between the two is the ordering of the values in the $(track_mask)s weight array.  In a
   "Track TrackMask", the weights are ordered in the same way that $(transform_track)s are
   ordered in the relevant $track_group.  In a "Model TrackMask", the weights are in the
   same order as the $(bone)s in the $(model)'s $skeleton.  When you apply the $track_mask
   to the animation, you specify either $SetTrackGroupModelMask/$SetControlModelMask, or
   $SetTrackGroupTrackMask/$SetControlTrackMask.  The meaning of those should now be
   clear, but the naming convention is tricky, so watch out!

   The example below is simple the code from $TutorialDX9Rendering, altered so that
   everything not relating to creating and applying the $track_mask is moved out of the
   tutorial file.  You can find the implementation of the rendering, update, etc in
   track_mask_helpers.cpp, but I recommend you look at $TutorialDX9Rendering instead, if
   you need clarification.  The expository comments are more complete in that project.

    /* Ok, this next chunk is the interesting stuff.  In the scene we're using, there are
       several models, but we're only going to work with the Pixomatic character.  We'll
       create a track mask that selects out ust the upper body.  When we play back the
       animation, the moves for the upper body will be exactly the same as those in
       $TutorialDX9Rendering, but the legs will stay imobile.  Normally, you'd be playing
       a separate animation, or running an IK chain on the legs to blend with the upper
       body, but to demonstrate the process, we'll just leave them static.

       When you use a $track_mask, you're responsible for making sure that the object is
       valid for the lifetime of the control.  In this demo, we're just going to leak the
       reference, since we're not trying to demonstrate memory management, but in a real
       app, you need to make sure that you wait until after GrannyFreeControl to delete
       the $track_mask.  (Using $FreeTrackMask, of course!)

/* Well, if you've run the test app, you know that looked pretty strange.  Once you get
   more comfortable with the idea of playing animation only on certain parts of the model,
   you can try creating some effects that don't look odd.  In general, the playing only
   one animation with a $track_mask isn't all that useful, except, as in this case, to
   illustrate how to do it.

   Remember also that since Granny refers to the $track_mask by pointer, you can change
   the way the mask works dynamically by just setting the weights over time.  So we could
   drive the upper/lower split above with a sinusoidal function, or blend different parts
   of an animation in and out as other animations become active, etc.
