/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialTreeWalker) (TutorialTreeWalker_Introduction, Introduction) */
/* The Granny file format is at its core, a way of storing a data tree rooted in a single
   object.  The object's data is written out together with type information that makes it
   possible to store arbitrary data at any point in the tree.  (You've already seen one
   example of this in $TutorialExtendedData.)  This allows you to write tools that are
   extremely robust with respect to file format changes, you can either request that
   Granny automatically perform the conversion, as we do when converting a file from a
   previous version of the exporter, or you can take full control, and use
   reflection-style programming to dynamically make determinations about what the file
   contains.

   As a for instance, $TransformFile makes an attempt to change the data contained in
   $mesh vertices and animation curves to match the requested coordinate system, but for
   efficiency reasons, doesn't try to find extended data members that may need to be
   converted as well.  Using the $data_type_definition metadata, you can easily write
   functions that traverse every data member in the file, looking for $(transform)s that
   will handle every ExtendedData transform, position, or orientation member.

   You could also use the metadata to create custom editors that allow your artists or
   programmers to modify values in the Granny file directly.  There is enough information
   here to feed to a GUI creation system that can create human-readable interfaces
   directly from your game-ready binary files.  The Granny Viewer uses this technique to
   create its detailed data views.

   <b>Note:</b> This tutorial contains the source for the grn.exe utility referenced in
   various places in the Granny documentation.  This is an extremely handy little utility,
   you should make sure to build this project, and add it to your toolbox.  This also
   means that there are some details like argument parsing that may be safely ignored for
   the purposes of learning about walking the data description tree.

               $texture.

               When you have a contained structure like this, you can either use an inline
               member to describe it, or put its fields directly into the type array of
               the containing object.  $InlineMember is the recommended method, since you

               than duplicating the type descriptors.

               $InlineMember isn't a pointer value that will come up again in the file, so
