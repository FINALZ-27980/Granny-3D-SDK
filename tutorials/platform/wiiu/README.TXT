This is a preview build of the WiiU port of Granny.  As such, we're shipping a *very*
simple demo.  You can find the example code in tutorials/platform/wiiu, where you can
compile and run using the Nintendo cygwin environment.

In our version of the Multi compiler, we ran into too many problems to reliably distribute
sample applications as an IDE project, so for the moment, please open cygwin to the WiiU
tutorial directory and execute one of the following:

  make          (Compiles the application)
  make run      (Compiles and starts the application)
  make debugger (Compiles and starts the application in the debugger)

Please let us know of any issues you encounter in building or running Granny on the WiiU!
Drop a line at any time to granny3@radgametools.com.  Thanks!
