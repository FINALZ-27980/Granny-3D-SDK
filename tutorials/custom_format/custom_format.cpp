/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialCustomFormat) (TutorialCustomFormat_Introduction, Introduction) */
/* This tutorial shows you how to use Granny's file API with your own data.  This
   obviously isn't necessary in order to use Granny for just animation and model data, but
   there are several good reasons you might want to consider using the Granny file format
   for more than just what comes out of the box.  You get automatic versioning, so you
   almost never have to throw away data from a previous version of your toolchain just
   because you've changed your structures.  You also get pointer-fixups and endian
   conversion, which allow you to deal with your data as vanilla C-structures in memory,
   without worrying about allocations or byte-swapping.  Granny automatically flattens
   your data when it's written out, which lets you load your files with only a single
   allocation, if that's important to you.
   $-
   In this demo, we'll create an entity database, a list of structures that represent game
   objects to be created on level load.  We'll keep it simple, giving each entity a base
   transform, a flags member, and a string indicating the runtime class of the object.  To
   demonstrate Granny's ability to handle arbitrary reference patterns in the file
   routines, each Entity will have a SiblingObject field, that will refer to another
   object in the database.

/* First, our entity structure.  We're going to use a $transform to represent the
   position of the object, but you can easily use raw float values to encode your own
   matrices.  In general, you should always use the Granny typedefs to represent the data
   in a custom structure.  Any type except those with "x" designators may be used.  (For
   instance, $int32x.) */

/* We need to describe the Entity structure to Granny.  You do that with an array of
   $data_type_definition objects.  In general, the $member_type will cover just about any
   type you want, if you feel there's something missing, please let us know!  Ultimately,
   the idea is to break down each strucuture into basic datatypes, so you'll need one of
   these per user data type.  Structures can refer to each other using the
   $ReferenceMember field, or contain sub-members of a known type with $InlineMember.

   Note that the Sibling object refers to it's own data type in the $ReferenceMember
   declaration.

/* Next we need to create the container that will act as our root object.  Each Granny
   file is essentially a graph that is rooted in a single object of a specified type.  In
   this case, we want to have a simple list of references to Entity object.  We'll add a
   second list of pointers to the objects that have the "Camera" class to demonstrate how
   Granny can handle arbitrary reference graph structures.
   $-
   Note that Granny arrays are always prefixed with a count to make iteration and
   allocation easier.  In general, it's a good idea to follow the Granny convention of
   naming these variables "[Item]Count" and "[Item]s", though this is not required.

    /* When you're working with Granny data definitions, it's a very good idea to make
       sure that the actual size of the object is what Granny thinks it is.  In general
       each member in a Granny structure should be aligned to a 4-byte boundary.  (This
       includes doubles, and pointers on 64-bit platforms.)  One pitfall to be aware of is
       that you should use the granny_bool32 type for boolean values, rather than a
       primitive bool, since the size of the builtin type can vary from compiler to
       compiler. */

    /* Now we need to create a $file_builder to write out our Database.  We'll create a
       very simple output file, so we specify a single section.  The tag is your way of
       indicating what the file type and version are at the time of writing.  We recommend
       that you choose 5 random hex digits, and represent the version in the lower 12 bits
       of the id.  This gives you 4096 versions before you run into trouble, which should
       be sufficient.

       $GRNFileMV_ThisPlatform indicates that we want the file optimized for the current
       platform.  You can specify any $grn_file_magic_value enumerant here to customize
       the output for a given platform.  For instance, if we were creating this file to be
       loaded on an Xbox 360, we would use $GRNFileMV_32Bit_BigEndian for optimum
       performance when loading on the console.  Any Granny file will load on any
       platform, but specifying the correct platform allows Granny to skip the endian
       marshalling or pointer size conversion operations, which take time.

       $GetTemporaryDirectory and "Prefix" simply indicate to Granny where temp files
       created during the file writing process should be stored.  If you don't want to
       create temp files in the filesystem, you can use $BeginFileInMemory to stage the
       entire file creation process in RAM. */
