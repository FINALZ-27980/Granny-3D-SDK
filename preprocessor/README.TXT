  For console licensees, who may not have a copy of the Win32 Granny
SDK, we've provided a library to link the preprocessor against so you
can develop your own preprocessor commands.  The included
granny.[h|lib|dll] will allow you to build the preprocessor project,
and make use of the Granny data manipulation APIs in your custom
commands.

  This is provided as a convenience only, if you want to distribute an
application on Win32 that uses Granny, you'll need to obtain a
license.  Contact sale3@radgametools.com for details.
