<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Granny Animation Studio! This document helps you get
up and running by loading and animating a simple character. If you've
never worked with the Animation Studio before, this is the best place
to begin. If you've worked with the Animation Studio in an earlier
incarnation during the beta period, please do breeze through the
document, we've added many features and streamlined many others.</p>

<p>Before we begin, let's cover some terminology as used in this
tutorial.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model</strong><br>
The skeleton and mesh that the Animation Studio displays
in the preview pane.</li>
<li><strong>Character</strong><br>
We'll use this term to refer to the state machine and blend
graphs that you'll be editing with the tool. Note that nothing in
the Studio precludes you from animating mechanical objects rather
than humans, but we'll be using mostly traditional human/animal
animations as examples.</li>
<li><strong>Animation</strong><br>
Here, a single animation clip targeted to your model.</li>
<li><strong>Node</strong><br>
Used to refer to either a state or a blend graph computation.</li>
<li><strong>State</strong><br>
A distinct behavior of your character. "Running", "idle",
"crouching" are all candidates. May be either a simple animation,
a blend graph, or a full state machine in it's own right.</li>
<li><strong>Transition</strong><br>
Controls how and when your character may move between states.</li>
<li><strong>State Machine</strong><br>
A collection of states and their associated transitions. The
root level of your character is always a state machine.</li>
<li><strong>Blend Graph</strong><br>
Represents an animation blending computation.  Composed of a
set of nodes, and connections that wire the inputs/outputs to
specify the blends to perform.  Ultimately, node outputs flow
to the next level up in the hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Tour">A Quick Tour of the Interface</h2>

<p>The Animation Studio is visually very sparse, by design. Broadly,
there are only three or four main interactions you'll be returning to
for every character. Of those interactions, you'll mainly be placing
nodes, editing their parameters, and dragging connections between
them. Anything not relating to this primary task of node
specification has been removed so you can deal with it only when
necessary.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/main_interface.png"><img src="studio_images/main_interface_small.png" alt="Animation Studio main interface" title="" /></a></p>

<p>The basic components of the main interface are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Preview pane: As you edit the character, you'll preview your
changes here. Tabs around the top and bottom of this pane hide
configuration and debugging tools. More on that later.</p></li>
<li><p>Node parameter editor: The currently selected node exposes its
parameters here. Currently, the root state machine of the character
is selected, so we see the actions permissible for that object.</p></li>
<li><p>Node creation bar: New nodes are created by clicking or dragging
from this bar.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that there is one hotkey that you should know right away, which
is that '?' will pop up a dialog that explains the keyboard shortcuts
available to you.</p>

<h2 id="SpecifyModel">Specify your Model</h2>

<p>Before adding any animations or behaviors to your character, you're
going to need to tell the Studio which skeleton and mesh you'll be
working with. (You can always retarget your character to another
model, but the model you specify here should be the "natural" model
for the animations you'll be working with, that is, the skeleton for
which the animations were authored.)</p>

<p>You specify your model file with the "Set Model..." button in the
"File and Character" dropdown of the preview pane. (Note that any
button with a combobox dropdown indicator on the right allows you to
select one of your recent files very quickly.)</p>

<p><img src="studio_images/file_and_character.png" alt="File and character" title="" /></p>

<p>Simply select the appropriate GR2 file that contains your skeleton and
mesh data. The model should immediately appear in the preview pane. If
it doesn't, the first skeleton in the file might not be your
character. (It's common for files to contain models for cameras,
lights, etc.) Simply select the correct model from the dropdown menu
directly to the right of the "Set Model..." button.</p>

<h2 id="AnimationSet">Create an Animation Set</h2>

<p>Before you specify any animation states, you will need to provide a
set of animation sources.  We'll come back to the idea of an Animation
Set later, when we talk about character variations, but for now, think
of it as the list of animation clips that are available to your
character.  You access the animation set manager either through the
"File and Character" menu, or by hitting <span class="keystroke">Control-A</span> at any time.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/set_manager.png"><img src="studio_images/set_manager_small.png" alt="Animation Set Manager" title="" /></a></p>

<p>The elements here are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set selection and file loading</li>
<li>Source list</li>
<li>Animation slots</li>
<li>Preview pane</li>
</ol>

<p>As you add animations to the set, they will populate the sources list
on the left of of the dialog.  The first column shows you which file
the clips are stored in, the other column displays the available clips
in that file.  (There may only be one, but it's considered best
practice to combine individual clips into larger files if possible.)
Below, I've loaded a single file that provides 12 different walk cycle
clips.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/animation_set_manager.png"><img src="studio_images/animation_set_manager_small.png" alt="Animation Set Manager" title="" /></a></p>

<p>On the right side of the dialog are the animation slots.  These are
named descriptions of an animation clip.  In this case "Fast" refers
to the run_fast clip in our source.  Animation nodes refer to slots,
rather than to animations directly so that you can replace them in
character variants without altering the node structure.</p>

<p>You may specify slots individually by adding them with the "Add new
animation slot" button provided, but the quickest and most foolproof
way to add slots is to drag sources from the source list into the slot
list, as shown.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/drag_to_create.mp4"><img src="studio_images/drag_to_create_small.gif" alt="Animation Set Manager" title="" /></a></p>

<p>For even more speed, you can drag the source file itself, and create
slots for all of it's component animations at once.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/drag_source.mp4"><img src="studio_images/drag_source_small.gif" alt="Animation Set Manager" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Simply hit "Escape" to dismiss the animation set manager when you are
finished with it.</p>

<h2 id="PlaceNodes">Placing and Editing Nodes</h2>

<p>At this point we have a character loaded and we have a set of
animations for it.  Now we simply need to create a few states to
complete the initial process of character design.  The most basic
animation state is a simple animation, so we'll place two of
those. Using the node creation bar, you can either click on the
appropriate icon, or drag it into the editing area as shown.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/create_node.mp4"><img src="studio_images/create_node_small.gif" alt="Animation Set Manager" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Before we go any further, there are a couple things to note that will
come in handy as you create more complicated characters.  First, each
rectangle here represents a state that the character can be in. We
haven't yet specified what those states <em>do</em>, so they are simply given
the default name of "Animation", which reflects their type. The node
on the left, has two internal indicators.  The star indicates that
this is the start state of the character.  Every time you load this
character in the game, it will begin in this state.  (You can override
this from code, of course.)  The second indicator, the rectangle with
selection indicators means that this is also the <em>current</em> state,
which is displayed in the preview pane.  You change the current state
of the character by right clicking on the desired node.</p>

<p>Editing a node is as simple as right-clicking it's icon.  This will
pop up an attached dialog that contains the parameters for that node
in it's present context.  To dismiss this dialog, either right-click
on the icon again, or hit escape to clear all open editing boxes.  As
an example, let's take the start state of the graph, and set the
animation source to our spawn animation. We'll also change this
animation to be a "One Shot" animation, so that it won't continuously
loop.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/edit_node.mp4"><img src="studio_images/edit_node_small.gif" alt="Animation Set Manager" title="" /></a></p>

<p>You may have noticed that there are more animations than will fit on
the screen for this character, which can cause problem if you use the
normal drop-down selection process. To help you quickly find animation
clips, selection drop-downs also support an iTunes-style filtered
selection. Simply click in the text region of the combobox, and you
can enter a filter string to look for the animation you need. Below,
we set the other state for this character to one of the idle
animations.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/edit_node_filter.mp4"><img src="studio_images/edit_node_filter_small.gif" alt="Animation Set Manager" title="" /></a></p>

<h2 id="NodeInteractions">Basic Node Interactions</h2>

<p>Let's take a brief moment to cover some very basic node
interactions other than editing.  One of the important tools for
keeping your animations orderly is a good naming convention for your
nodes.  By default, animation nodes will take the name of the
animation slot you assign to them (unless you've already changed the
name!), but everything else is up to you.  To change the name of an
animation state or blend graph node, you can either right-click on its
name, or press the "F2" key to rename it Windows-style.
</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/renaming.mp4"><img src="studio_images/renaming_small.gif" alt="Renaming nodes" title=""/></a></p>

<p>There are two state-machine specific settings you need to know as
well.  Each state has two small regions that indicate if the node is
the "start state" for the machine (that is, the state that the
character will choose by default when loaded), and if it is the
current state.  These are the two small boxes right next to the node
icon.  The start state is indicated by a star, while the current state
is a small, highlighted rectangle.
</p>

<p>You can move either of these indicators by right clicking in the
regions.  For the start state, there won't be any visible change, but
the next time the character activates, it will assume this state by
default.  Clicking on the "current state" region will make that state
current.  If there is a transition available, the studio will use it,
but we assume that if you click on the node, you want to force that
state, so we'll pop if necessary.  In the movie below, I'm testing the
spawn state, which has an "on-loop" transition that we'll create next.
This forces the character back to it's start state, until it loops,
and assumes the idle state.  (Notice that moving the start state at
the end has no immediate effect on the preview character.)
</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/set_state.mp4"><img src="studio_images/set_state.gif" alt="Renaming nodes" title=""/></a></p>


<h2 id="Transitions">Specifying Transitions</h2>

<p>Once you have a couple of states for your character, you'll need to
tell Granny which transitions are allowed, and parameterize them.  The
simple character we've created thus far has only a spawn state and an
idle state, so it's natural for there to be only one transition:
"Spawn to Idle", which should trigger automatically at the end of the
Spawn animation.</p>

<p>In order to drag a transition, you click in the darker colored ring
around the edge of the start node and drag to the target node.
(Clicking in the central region selects or moves the node.)  We'll
specify that spawn to idle transition, and set its type to "On Loop",
which tells Granny to trigger the transition when the animation
reaches its end point.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/drag_transition.mp4"><img src="studio_images/drag_transition_small.gif" alt="Animation Set Manager" title="" /></a></p>

<h2 id="blendgraphs">Blend Graphs</h2>

<p>The next piece of the puzzle is making a more complicated animation
state that requires multiple animation sources and blends them
together.  Nodes in the state machine may be either simple animations,
as we've seen thus far, or they can contain full blend graphs, which
don't have states, but inputs and outputs. We'll create a locomotion
state which blends between a walk and a jog, controlled by a parameter
slider at the top level.  There's a lot to accomplish in this quick
demo, so definitely watch this animation enough times to catch what's
happening here.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/blend_graph.mp4"><img src="studio_images/blend_graph_small.png" alt="Animation Set Manager" title="" /></a></p>

<p>There are several brand-new interactions here, so let's cover them
quickly.  First, note that the parameter node that we created is a
different color than the other nodes.  This indicates that it
is <em>not</em> an animation state, but a parameter source.  Second,
we jumped <em>into</em> the blend-graph node, which you do by simply
double-clicking on it.  You back out to the top level of your
character either by using the breadcrumb trail along the top of the
node window (@ 0:35 in this example), or by using the Back button on
your mouse or keyboard.</p>

<p>The visual appearance of blend graph nodes is distinctly different
than the state machine nodes to tell you which mode you're currently
in.  The convention is that node inputs are on the left, node outputs
on the right.  Parameter flow in from the top-left of the graph, and
the outputs are at the top right.  We've taken the "Speed" input from
the top level, and used it to control the blend node which is mixing
the walk and jog animations here.</p>

<p>To create the blending node, we've moved into one of the other tabs of
the node creation bar.  If you were to If you look at those tabs when
editing a state machine node, you'll find them disabled, since a
"Blend" operation doesn't make sense as a state.  (States are self
contained, and have no inputs, only the outputs expected by the state
machine.)</p>

<p>The color of the edges and connectors tells you what type of data is
expected or produced, and therefore which connections are valid. As
you play around with the nodes, the edge types will become obvious,
but to get you started:</p>

<ul>
<li>Green: Model pose data</li>
<li>Blue: Scalar parameters</li>
<li>Red: Mask information</li>
<li>Yellow: Events</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll encounter all of these in the more advanced tutorials.</p>

<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>It's inevitable that something is going to go wrong with your
character. An animation will be wrong, or a transition will be too
short or too long, some node might not have its parameters set at all,
etc.  The Studio provides several powerful tools to help debug your
character.  First, to make it possible to make drastic changes to your
character without fear of losing work, the Studio supports an infinite
undo stack.  This is invoked with <span
class="keystroke">Control-Z</span>.</p>

<p>Second, for more fine-grained examinations, you can use the Time
Scrubber in the preview window.  This allows you to move time back and
forth, all the way back to the last undoable operation.  So if there
is a transition, or a blend that is incorrect, you can examine the
current state, parameters, etc., over time to see how they are
contributing to the incorrect result.  In our example character, the
spawn animation is slightly mismatched to the lead-in of the idle
state.  You can see below that the left front leg of the tiger is in a
different position when the current state moves from Spawn to Idle.
Once the problem is diagnosed, we can inform the artists, or correct
the problem by editing the transitions or blends.</p>

<p><a href="studio_images/time_scrub.mp4"><img src="studio_images/time_scrub.gif" alt="Animation Set Manager" title="" /></a></p>

<p>There is one other small feature that might come in handy. I won't
demonstrate this with a video, but the next time you place an
animation node, look just to the right of the animation selection
combobox. If Granny can figure out the Maya or Max source file that
your animation clip originated from, the "Edit" button will be
enabled. Clicking that should open the file in your 3D editor so you
can make changes. The Animation Studio will automatically reload any
changed source files on disk, so you never have to reload your
character as you're altering the source art.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">That was Quick!</h2>

<p>There is a tremendous amount more to cover in the Animation Studio,
but we'll pause here.  I would recommend that you take time to create
the graph shown in the last set of examples, just so you can be sure
that the flow of the application is clear.  You'll find the Sedna
character in the "tutorials/media/gstate" directory of your Granny
distribution. Our thanks to Gas Powered Games for generously allowing
us to use this model from "Demigod" in our samples!</p>
